## Introduction

This is an email marketing plugin built specifically for Filament Admin Panel. It aims to bring the distribution of content by email into the admin panel, where we believe it should be, along with the same ethos of flexibility and user-friendliness that FilamentPHP provides. This package is based on the open-source project [SendPortal Core](https://github.com/mettle/sendportal-core).


## Features
Includes subscriber and list management, email campaigns, message tracking, reports and multiple workspaces/domains in a modern, flexible and scalable application.

Integrates with [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses), [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com), [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) and [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com).


## Requirements
Filaletter requires:

- PHP 8.2+
- Laravel 11+
- MySQL (≥ 5.7) or PostgreSQL (≥ 9.4)
- Filament Admin Panel 3.2 or higher
