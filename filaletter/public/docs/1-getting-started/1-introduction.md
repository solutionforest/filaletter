# Newsletter Plugin for Filament

This is an email marketing plugin built specifically for Filament Admin Panel. It aims to bring the distribution of content by email into the admin panel, where we believe it should be, along with the same ethos of flexibility and user-friendliness that FilamentPHP provides. This package is based on the open-source project [Sendportal core](https://github.com/mettle/sendportal-core).

- Complete control and personalization of emails using templates.
- Integrates seamlessly with Amazon SES, Mailgun, Mandrill, Sendgrid, etc.
- Unlimited campaigns, subscribers, mailing lists, and sendouts.
