# Messages

## Overview

After a campaign has been dispatched, a message will be generated for each targeted subscriber. A message represents a single email. You can view all of your messages by clicking the **Messages** link in the sidebar. You will notice that there are two types of messages:

### Drafts

A draft is a message that has been queued using the **Queue Draft** campaign sending behavior. The **Drafts** tab offers a listing of every drafted message and allows you to preview the final message before sending. A draft message will only be sent to the subscriber when you click on the **Send Now** button.

### Sent

Similarly, the **Sent** tab offers a listing of every message that has been dispatched. You can use this page to track and filter the status of your messages.
