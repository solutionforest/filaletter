# SMTP

## Sending Emails

Filaletter can also send your campaigns via SMTP. If you select this option, you will not be able to track your campaigns. For example, deliveries, open, and click tracking will not be available.

For production environments, we recommend using one of the API Email Services instead of SMTP.

To create an SMTP Email Service in Filaletter, navigate to the **Email Services** tab, click the **Add Email Service** button, and enter the relevant details, making sure to select **SMTP** as the type.
